<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='kenya'>Kenya</h2>

Kenya is a vibrant and diverse East African nation with beautiful landscapes and rich cultures. The country, nestled on the equator, has amazing infrastructure, and its citizens are welcoming and friendly. 

<h3 id='nairobi'>Nairobi</h3>

Nairobi is Kenya's capital and largest city, with an estimated population of 5,325,160 as of 2023. It serves as the country's economic, political, and cultural heart. The metropolis is located in the south-central part of Kenya and is the biggest city in Eastern Africa, making it a very ethnically and culturally diverse city where all the major ethnic tribes reside, besides Asians, Europeans, and expatriates. It also serves as the entry point to many African countries.

Nairobi is a hub for many international organisations and a gateway to some of Africa's most renowned national parks and wildlife reserves. The city has cultural attractions like museums, art galleries, and vibrant street markets. Visitors can savour a wide range of cuisines from both local and international food chains. Whether you are interested in history, wildlife, or shopping, Nairobi is the city.  

The city has successfully hosted some major conferences, including Africa Climate Summit  (2023), UN Environment Assembly 5 (2022), RCMRD International Conference (2023), amongst many other regional and global events.

<h3>Weather</h3>

Nairobi enjoys a tropical climate zone with a moderate and favourable yearly climate. The month of September is generally perfect, with minimal rainfall averaging about 18mm in roughly only 5 days. The temperature in the month of September is cool, with a high of 24°C and a low of 11°C.

<h3>Language</h3>

Kenya’s national language is English. The official language is Swahili which is spoken by pretty much every Kenyan local. In Nairobi, most people communicate in English and Swahili and a vast group of younger generations use slang or what we call sheng-which is a mixture of various local dialects including English and Swahili.

<h3>Flights</h3>

Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA)  is an international airport serving Nairobi and Africa’s premier hub and ideal gateway into and out of East and Central Africa. The airport is situated 18km from the central business district and is the largest and busiest aviation facility in East Africa. It is the hub of Kenya Airways, the national flag carrier, Jambojet, and serves over 40 passenger airlines, including Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, RwandAir. Alternative international aviation facilities are Kisumu International Airport, Eldoret International Airport, and Moi International Airport in Mombasa, with the rest spread across Kenyan regions.

<h3>Bus Travel Within East and Southern Africa</h3>

Road transport is commonly used within East African countries on a daily basis because of the good road infrastructure, security, and cost effectiveness. The recent infrastructural developments and easened custom borders process have made bus travelling easier in other neighbouring regions of south and central Africa.

<h3>Public Transport</h3>

Nairobi City has a diverse privatised public transport system linking the Central Business District to the residential, commercial, and industrial areas across the metropolitan. Integrated with few government operated public transportation like the train system and some bus companies, the public transport is dominated by ‘Matatus’ (basic 14 seater vans, 27 and above seater buses). Non-citizen guests are not recommended to use the matatus because of the navigation challenges unless a local guide accompanies them.

<h3>Taxis</h3>

Like any other modern city, Nairobi enjoys a series of taxi services that operate 24 hours daily, with some running as international models (including ride-share apps like Uber and Bolt) and some locally owned and operated ones. You can either access the service through mobile phone applications or at some strategicly located places within the city. Taxis are the most convenient form of transport and prove to be safest.

<h2>Visa</h2>

Kenya as a country is such a welcoming state with open borders for most countries worldwide. In early 2024, there have been some changes in the Visa [requirement](https://immigration.ecitizen.go.ke/index.php?id=6) and [aquisition process](https://immigration.go.ke/border-management/arrival-procedures-and-the-responsibility-of-travelers-on-arrival/) for Kenya: Foreign citizens are allowed entry into Kenya once they acquire an electronic travel authorization (ETA / eVisa). Citizens of [East Africa Community](https://www.eac.int/) member states are exempt from this requirement.

To obtain a Visa to visit Kenya, one needs a valid passport and a Yellow fever vaccination certificate, as required by the government [ministry of health](https://health.go.ke/incoming-travellers). The eVisa can be acquired through the [online platform](https://evisa.go.ke). The eVisa should be made available between 2- 14 days after application and making the necessary payment. NB: Visas can also be acquired on arrival at the airport.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='accommodation'>Accommodation</h2>

Considering the central location of the host institution, there is a wide range of accommodation services ranging from hotels, Airbnbs, and shared hostels, all with a huge range of amenities including swimming pools, rooftop restaurants, spa and health club and airport shuttle. All these facilities are spread within the city, with easy access to main roads, with others as close as walking distance from the university. Both hotels and Airbnb can rate from as low as $20 for a bed and breakfast, and hostels that can be as low as $15 a night.

<h3>Food</h3>

Nairobi is a multicultural city, which makes it a hub of diverse culinary experiences, offering a range of options for foodies from local to international dishes. You can find these restaurants within the central business district or outside. Depending on your taste buds for the day, you will find the restaurant that fits.

<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='conference-venue'>Venue</h2>

<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='healthcare'>Public Healthcare</h2>

Kenya as a country falls within the tropics therefore experiences comfortable climatic conditions which are favourable for a host of disease causing organisms. One might experience mosquitoes and other microorganisms within the ecosystem but Nairobi is not a Malaria prone zone, neither is the city at risk of any organism-caused health risks. It is important to note that any guests or persons should be responsible for their personal hygiene to avoid any unforeseen situations.

**Tap Water should not be ingested unless clearly indicated otherwise.**

In case of any medical emergency, kindly call these numbers Amref (+254 20 699 2299), AAR (+254 734 225 225).

<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='safety'>Personal Safety</h2>

Nairobi is a quite welcoming city in general, but not every corner is [safe](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/kenya/safety-and-security#crime): mugging, robbery and carjacking are frequent incidents. One should consider the company of a local person to visit most places around the city, especially Eastleigh, Central Business District, Mathare, Kibera and slum areas, as well as isolated areas in general. You might be at higher risk of attracting muggers if you appear to be in ownership of expensive items. Be vigilant at all times, but especially so around bus stations, railway stations and airports. Also be aware of thieves posing as police officers and private security guards.

**Should you get attacked, do not resist! In an emergency, contact the emergency services on 999 or 112.**

The conference will try to provide sufficient information about personal safety in Nairobi. Aditionally, local volunteers can give further advice, answer your questions and help.

LGBTQ community members are allowed to enter Kenya but it is important to mention that the nation is conservative when it comes to traditions and practices and therefore public showcasing of such related acts might expose one to public criticism. Unfortunately, there are no proper legal frameworks to protect this group of people.



<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='internet'>Internet</h2>

The venue provides you with reliable and convenient internet connectivity. However, we advise you to have a personal internet/data plan as backup plan in case of any glitches like in the case of not being within WiFi reach. You can easily purchase a new Safaricom (largest telecommunication provider) SIM card at the airport or any of their shop outlets in Nairobi town CBD. Safaricom offers you fast internet services and various data plans that start from as low as $5. You have the freedom to choose from other service providers such as Airtel and Telkom Kenya, who also offer good internet packages and data plans. The best practice is to download the mobile app for a given service provider from the google play store then proceed to purchase the desired data plan.

The SIM card you purchase will not only enable you to communicate, but also act as an e-wallet that allows you to make financial transactions across many shops, supermarkets, and pay for various services. You would be amazed at the digital literacy amongst Kenyans and how they have embraced technology that enables them to accept mobile based payments, and/or hard cash. You can also enjoy the convenience of online shopping by using mobile apps like Glovo and Jumia Online Shopping. Getting food and other essentials delivered to your door is also an option with available options from outlets like Foodplus, Naivas & Carrefour.

Moreover, you can also access online medical services through platforms like myDawa & Ponea health,which offer you quick access to professional consultation, drug dispensation and delivery with much ease.
